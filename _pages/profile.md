* I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Economics at [Nanyang Technological University](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx). During which, i had exposure to Matlab and C++ for 3 modules. Also, I did econometrics which emphasize heavily on regression and time series regression.  

* I was lucky to be given the opportunity to learn and apply data science despite not having any prior experience and this give me the chance to learn and dabble in it day to day. I started with time series - statistical modelling which i was familiar for some analysis for my company. 

* Slowly and surely, I got into machine learning and I definitely fell in love with it. 

* I spend ALOT of time in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Think of it as a competitive game except, you are solving free business problems using data science, machine learning ...etc The best way to learn is also to apply you! Do not stay stuck in MOOCs. Get your hands dirty! 

* Within a short span of 5 months, I have participated in 3 kaggle competitions and obtain 2 medals. I definitely learn a lot from the great community. If you want to get exposure as well as know the current state of the art algorithms, you will not go wrong with kaggle competitons. 

* Contact me if you want to discuss on data science / machine learning :)
