I am a data scientist who aims to solve different business problems for clients. I aim to solve questions using data, utilizing predicitive as well as prescriptive analytics.

_<center>This is what a data scientist does!</center>_ 

Apart from that, I am very interested in state of the art machine learning and deep learning techniques. Since young, I have been intrigued by how artificial intelligence works (see Will Smith's I,Robot). I have also participate in kaggle frequently and obtained the **[kaggle expert](https://www.kaggle.com/germmie)** title as of now. 

Future plans will be to participate more, learn and exposure more as well as get my hands on deep learning. Hopefully one day I will get the kaggle master title. 

Other hobbies includes soccer, photography as well as toy collecting!
