I'm an analyst working in [Cognizant Singapore currently](https://www.cognizant.com/singapore). My day to day task includes but not limited to working on data analysis as well as predictive analytics for internal stakeholders. 

Apart from that, I am very interested in state of the art machine learning and deep learning techniques. Since young, I have been intrigued by how artificial intelligence works (see Will Smith's I,Robot). I have also participate in kaggle frequently and obtained the **kaggle expert** title as of now. 

Future plans will be to participate more, learn and exposure more as well as get my hands on deep learning. Hopefully one day I will get the kaggle master title. 

Other hobbies includes soccer, photography as well as toy collecting!
