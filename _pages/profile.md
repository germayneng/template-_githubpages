* I fell in love with Data science one year ago. Since then, I have been messing around with data science during my work as well as during my personal free time. 

* I spend ALOT of time in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Think of it as a competitive game except, you are solving free business problems using data science, machine learning ...etc The best way to learn is also to apply you! Do not stay stuck in MOOCs. Get your hands dirty! 

* Contact me if you want to discuss on data science / machine learning :)
