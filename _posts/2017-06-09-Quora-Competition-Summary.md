Hardwork...

<center><img src="http://www.sociobits.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Quora.jpg"></center>


After 3 months of intensive, gruelling and hardwork, my team (consisting of 2 machine learning amateurs) managed to secure our top 5 % placing, 
hence clenching a silver medal on Quora's competition on kaggle. I believe we did well because:

1. it is our first kaggle competition 
2. it is our first experience dealing with NLP based analytics

> Kaggle was founded as a platform for predictive modelling and analytics competitions on which companies and researchers post their data and statisticians and data miners from all over the world compete to produce the best models.
> Big companies would sponsor a prize pot for data scientist all over the world to provide a machine learning solution to a particular problem they wish to improve on. 

We put in lots of hours- learning, experimenting as well as running lots of computation intensive models. However, I would like to express my gratitude
to the kaggle community because along the way, despite it being a competition, people are not afraid to give some insights, hints as well as some findings in the discussion threads.
