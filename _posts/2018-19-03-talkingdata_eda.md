Kaggle recently launched a new competition, sponsored by talkingdata. Talkingdata is based in China, 

> TalkingData, Chinaâ€™s largest independent big data service platform, covers over 70% of active mobile devices nationwide.

For this competition, we are tasked with a creating a classification model, to predict if the users will download the app if they are to click on the mobile app ad. I have decided to share the EDA that I will be first doing before jumping into the modelling process. Since i am doing it straight on a r notebook, I will be sharing the link below to the hosted r notebook. You should be able to view it directly:
