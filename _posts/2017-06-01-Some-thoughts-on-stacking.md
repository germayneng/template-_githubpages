## Stacking


Stacking is the technique to mix a myriad of diverse machine learning models to achieve a stronger prediction. The intuitive idea is that each 
models will complement one another in a certain way. 

The concept of stacking is not really that complicated. It did took me awhile via self learning and researching to grasp the main concept. There are 
various tutorials from many sites including kaggle that explains how to go about doing stacking. But honestly, I was confused for quite sometime. 
As such, I decided to compile a markdown with an example from [Analytics Vidhya](https://analyticsvidhya) and further expand on it.
